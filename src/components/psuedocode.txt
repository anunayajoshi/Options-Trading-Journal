App main component. 

Form component 
    First asks for type of option play. Dropdown maybe? 
    Options - Stock/Call/Put/Vertical Spread/Iron Condor 

    When specific option is chosen, different components are rendered below it. 
    Maybe using switch:case to render, or if checkbox ticked && <Component>

    Component renders.

    Stock - Date, Ticker, Entry Price, Quantity, Close Date, Closing Price. 
    Auto calculates total entry cost + P/L and percentage. perhaps this calculation is another component that lives inside each type's.
    Yeah i can reuse that calculation method for the different types of plays. 

    Once submitted button is clicked (another component?), enters into the list 

    List Component, showing the details. 
    Date, Ticker, Type, Strike, Expiry, Entry Price, Quantity, Cost, Days to Expiration, Closing Date, Closing Price, Closing Amt, P/L, P/L%. 

    For stocks, strike,expiry and DTE will be nil/empty. default setstate will be empty so shd be ok to leave it as such?  

    Maybe include in a notes function as well, just a text field. 


    ok general idea done. to prioritise what is to be done. 


    1. Form Filling component 
    - contains checkbox of different plays possible, will only do stocks, calls and puts for now.  DONE. 
    
    2. Component for different strategies. Child of Form Filling Component. 
        - Create input fields 
        - Such that will render when checkbox ticked, and will dissapear when unticked. 
        - Passing data of checkbox state from parent component to child component. , turns out dont need pass. kept state within filerform.js

    3. Create List component
        - Tables and Rows for the respective fields.
        Date, Ticker, Type, Strike, Expiry, Entry Price, Quantity, Cost, Closing Date, Closing Price, Closing Amt, P/L, P/L%.
        - Wont deal with the calculations yet. 

    4. Work out state for submit button and List component. 
        - Not 100% on this.
        - using onchange, handlesubmit, and e.target.value for each input field. should be a easier way to do this?
        - when submit clicked, send values from form filling component to list component. 

    5. work out calculations component. 
    - once submit button clicked, sends over to Calculation component first, which then sends to List??
    - id say this one is just bonus

    6. CRUD maybe? 

    7. UI design, material UI table.
